## Observable Trends

-Overall, the 20-24 year age group contributes the most to total revenue at 64.16%. This is also the largest demographic at 44.79%, yeilding a per capita spending of 41.64% above the average ($3.05/person). This means that 20-24 year olds are a very important demographic.

-The highest spending group per capita was the 35-39 year olds, spending on average 56.07% more than the average ($3.05/person). They are small portion of the player base (5.38% of players) and do not generate a large portion of revenue (6.21% of Total Revenue). This means that drawing in more players in this age range could be highly profitable.

-Of the 5 users that spent the most money, 4 of them were in the 20-24 age group, though of their purchases only two items from the Most Profitable Items and Most Popular Items lists appeared, once each from different users (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm and Nirvana). This means that the people that spend the most do not necessarily purchase the most popular or expensive items.
